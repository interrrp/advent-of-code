## 🏃‍♂️ How to run

1. Find the folder of the day you want to run (`./year/day`). For example, if
   you want to run day 1 of 2023, you would go to `./2023/1`.

2. Place your puzzle input in a file called `input.txt` in that folder.

3. Run `deno run --allow-read <part>.ts` (replace `<part>` with the part you
   want to run) in that folder.
